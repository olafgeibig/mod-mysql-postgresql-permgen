                    These are executable jobs to perform some administrative tasks.
                    <b class="error">Do not execute jobs unless you exactly know what you're doing!</b>
                    Some of theses jobs perform massive updates to the database or send out notifications to a huge
                    number of customers. Please be careful.

                    <strong>Important</strong>: Many jobs have got a 'dry run' option and won't really be executed unless the option is unchecked.
                    During dry run everything is executed normally but without performing the real action, e.g. calling
                    an external API. Always test your job in 'dry run' mode and check if the job finishes successfully
                    with out any errors before unchecking 'dry run'.
